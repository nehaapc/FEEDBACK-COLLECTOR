# FEEDBACK-COLLECTOR
ðŸ’¬ Anonymous Feedback Collector
This is a pastel-themed feedback portal I built to help users share thoughts anonymously and securely. Itâ€™s lightweight, responsive, and designed for platforms or teams that want honest inputâ€”without forcing logins or tracking personal data.
I adapted the logic from my workplace harassment portal and customized it for general feedback. Users can select feedback type (bug report, feature request, UX issue, etc.), write a description, and optionally include their name, email, or organization. Submissions are validated and sent via EmailJS, with a unique tracking code generated for each entry.
âœ¨ Features
- Anonymous feedback form with optional fields
- Category selection and input validation
- EmailJS integration for direct delivery
- Unique tracking code for each submission
- Responsive layout with pastel pink & blue theme
- Confirmation modal and hover animations
- Sassy info section (because feedback should be fun)
