# FEEDBACK-COLLECTOR
ðŸ’¬ Anonymous Feedback Collector
This is a lightweight, pastel-themed feedback portal I built to help users share their thoughts anonymously and securely. Itâ€™s designed for platforms, events, or organizations that want honest input without forcing users to log in or reveal personal details.
I adapted the core logic from my workplace harassment reporting portal and restructured it for general feedback use cases. The form includes optional fields for name, email, and organization, plus required fields for feedback type and description. Submissions are validated and sent via EmailJS directly to my inbox, with a unique tracking code generated for each entry.
âœ¨ Features

This project reflects my focus on ethical design, user comfort, and clean UI/UX. Itâ€™s fully customizable and can be adapted for different audiences or branding needs. Whether youâ€™re collecting feedback for a product, event, or internal team, this portal makes it easy, safe, and even a little fun.
